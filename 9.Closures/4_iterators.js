//Types of programming languages:
//1. Imperative: C++, Java,
//You mention what to do and how to do as well
//You write merge sort and define eveyrthing how to do them
//2. Declarative: SQL
//You dont tell that how to give data from the table
/**
 * In Sql most of the time, we just write the command to do the task, not how to do it
 * We tell it to select the things not write how to select code
 *
 */

/**
 * In javascript
 * eg: arr = [1,2,3,4]
 * we do: arr[2]
 * We tell everythin, where to go, which index to go , what to pick
 * Here, actually dedicatedly define the collection and mention the steps to get data from the collection
 *
 * We are looking towards converting these to more declarative style

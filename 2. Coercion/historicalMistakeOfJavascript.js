console.log(typeof null) //This is a historical mistake in the making of javascript as null is defined as type object
//But how can null be an object, so this is a mistake by ecma script itself
//If it is a mistake then how come we havent resolved this mistake yet?
//Because a lot of legacy code are written with this
//a lot of code base follows this standard, so we cannot just change it and expect the world to be functioning normally tomorrow morning
